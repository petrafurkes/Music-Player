Data structures and Algorithms module - MusicPlayer project

Implement the data structure using any JAVA tool that allows a user to store the data for the music songs. 
Two data items, such as song title and released year are stored in the data structure for the music player. 
The data structure should store the data with the maximum of ten songs. 
The new songs can be added or removed from the list. 
When the music player is fully loaded (10 songs), the application displays information that you cannot add any more song in the list. 
• It can add the data for the song title name and released year
• It can remove the songs only from the top of the list
• It will display list of all ten songs stored in the music player in descending order
• The user can search a song from the list
• The user can terminate the application
